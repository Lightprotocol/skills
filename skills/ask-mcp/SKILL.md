# DeepWiki Research

Query repositories via DeepWiki MCP to answer technical questions with precise, source-backed answers.

## Workflow

1. **Clarify intent**
   - Recommend plan mode, if it's not activated
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` to resolve blind spots
   - All questions must be resolved before execution
2. **Identify references and skills**
   - Match task to [execution steps](#execution-steps) below
   - Locate relevant documentation and examples
3. **Write plan file** (YAML task format)
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` for anything unclear — never guess or assume
   - Identify blockers: permissions, dependencies, unknowns
   - Plan must be complete before execution begins
4. **Execute**
   - Use `Task` tool with subagents for parallel research
   - Subagents load skills via `Skill` tool
   - Track progress with `TodoWrite`
5. **When stuck**: spawn subagent with `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, DeepWiki MCP access and load `skills/ask-mcp`

## Execution Steps

### 1. Read Required Context in Local Repo

Use `/init` skill and index current repository, if you have not already

### 2. Identify Question Scope

Determine the domain:
- Programs, client SDKs, architecture, implementation details
- Specific components (LightAccount, ValidityProof, CPI, etc.)

### 2. Fetch Repository Context

Select the appropriate repository based on question scope:

**Light Protocol (compressed accounts, state trees, ZK compression, Light SDK)**
```
mcp__deepwiki__read_wiki_structure("Lightprotocol/light-protocol")
mcp__deepwiki__read_wiki_contents("Lightprotocol/light-protocol")
mcp__deepwiki__ask_question("Lightprotocol/light-protocol", "your question")
```

**Solana Development (programs, accounts, general Solana)**
```
mcp__deepwiki__read_wiki_structure("blueshift-gg/blueshift-dashboard")
mcp__deepwiki__read_wiki_contents("blueshift-gg/blueshift-dashboard")
mcp__deepwiki__ask_question("blueshift-gg/blueshift-dashboard", "your question")
```

**Claude Code (CLI features, commands, configuration)**
```
mcp__deepwiki__read_wiki_structure("anthropics/claude-code")
mcp__deepwiki__read_wiki_contents("anthropics/claude-code")
mcp__deepwiki__ask_question("anthropics/claude-code", "your question")
```

**Agent Skills (skills, subagents, patterns)**
```
mcp__deepwiki__read_wiki_structure("anthropics/skills")
mcp__deepwiki__read_wiki_contents("anthropics/skills")
mcp__deepwiki__ask_question("anthropics/skills", "your question")

### 3. Apply Precision Rules

**AVOID:**
- Vague verbs: "handles", "manages", "processes", "enables", "provides"
- Abstract nouns: "operations", "management", "coordination"
- -ing endings when a precise verb exists
- Marketing language: "comprehensive", "rich", "seamless",  "enables", "provides capability"
- ZK terminology in user-facing docs: "inclusion proof", "non-inclusion proof" → Instead describe what it does: "prove the address doesn't exist", "prove the account hash exists"
- Generic descriptions: "account metadata" instead of "CompressedAccountMeta"


**USE:**
- Exact function/method names
- Concrete data structures
- Specific operations: "sets discriminator", "creates hash", "nullifies account"
- File:line references
- "reference" when describing u8 indices that reference accounts in the accounts array (standard Solana terminology)
- "CPI" as a verb (e.g., "CPIs the Account Compression Program")
- Technical method/function names used as verbs when contextually clear

`Describe exactly what happens.`

### 4. Format Response

Structure answers with:
- Technical precision
- Code examples with inline comments
- Source references (file paths, line numbers)

## Example Output

**Question:** What do you include in instruction data for compressed account creation?

**Answer:**

---

## Compressed Account Creation Instruction Data

Instruction data contains three components for proof verification and tree coordination.

**Components:**

```rust
pub struct InstructionData {
    proof: ValidityProof,
    address_tree_info: PackedAddressTreeInfo,
    output_state_tree_index: u8,
    // + custom account data
}
```

**1. Non-inclusion proof**
- `ValidityProof` proves the derived address does not exist in the specified address tree
- Client generates via `getValidityProof()` RPC call

**2. Tree location parameters**
- `PackedAddressTreeInfo`: Specifies which address tree registers the address (u8 index, not pubkey)
- `output_state_tree_index`: Specifies which state tree stores the compressed account hash

**3. Custom account data**
- Program-specific fields (e.g., `message: String`, user data)

**Execution flow:**

1. Address tree proves uniqueness, stores address
2. State tree stores account hash
3. ValidityProof cryptographically guarantees address is unused

**Why separate trees:**

Compressed accounts require client-generated cryptographic proof that address doesn't exist (unlike regular Solana where runtime checks PDA existence). Address trees enforce uniqueness; state trees store account hashes.

**Packed structs** use `u8` indices to reference accounts in `remaining_accounts`, reducing transaction size.
